## Who am I?
I'm Cory Sabol (aka bit0pus, that's bit-oh-puhs, like magnum opus).
I work as a software developer and (sometimes) a pentester for [SecureIdeas](www.secureideas.com).
I'm also a hobby game developer in that I make terrible games that I'm ashamed of.

## What are we going to do?
I'm going talk at you about some half baked ideas that I have, about hacking/fingerprinting/escaping containers.
Then hopefully somebody who knows way more than me decides that they should share that knowledge and they then contribute
to this project and the sister project [Am-I-Being-Contained](https://github.com/ProfessionallyEvil/am-i-being-contained).

After that we'll try to use some of this stuff to escape a container. Maybe. I mean, hopefully.

### What is a container?
The word *container* get's thrown around a lot. It doesn't really mean too much. They are really just a way to run an isolated
process on a system.
